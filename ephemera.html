<th class="tg-xesh"><p>Hey, thanks for scanning! Here’s where I over-explain every little piece of the zine. The mystery is probably better than the truth, so it’s cool if you’re not into this sort of thing. But here we go: The zine is named <b>EPHEMERA</b> because I think it’s a cool word and concept. When you’re making stuff, it’s easy to slip into perfectionism and worry too much about whatever it is you’re creating. But if you remind yourself that it’s all essentially ephemera, it helps to lower the stakes in a way that I find extremely helpful.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of stuff I’ve made in the past that I now think sucks. But who cares? I’ll probably think this zine sucks at some point. But that’s growth, I guess! And not to get dark, but it’s actually ALL ephemera. Like, <u>all of it</u>, everything. You get it? So maybe worry a little less.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>The first page features a little guillotine graphic I made using Gustavo Zambelli's woodgrain pattern. It's paired with the "let's rock" typography lifted from Fire Walk With Me. The barbed wire and scribble is filler. But the "ephemera" logo is pretty cool, right?</p>
        
    <p>Page two has an introductory blurb over an outline of some brutalist architecture. WHen looking for inspiration, I scrolled through a ton of very old Tumblr likes and stumbled across the photo I used as reference. (I like the idea of this zine feeling like scrolling through some long-forgotten Tumblr likes.)</p>  
        
    <p>The "Can't Get You Out of My Head" design is inspired by the great Kylie Minogue song. It's a perfect song.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>On the next page, I go for some cheap nostalgia points with a Winamp player graphic (including another reference to "Can't Get You Out of My Head") and a t-posing Leon S. Kennedy from Resident Evil 4. This is all paired with printer test graphics and lyrics to the Portishead song "Only You." There's also a flower mark from a rejected client project.</p>
    
    <p>I took the "no outlet" photo on a disposable camera many years ago. I had planned on making a film photography zine, but never finished it. The "style over substance" is a criticism of this project. (I'm not saying a lot with this zine, just trying to have a good time.) The spread is closed out by a little meatballs experiment that I actually really like, however it’s dwarfed by some meaningless circles.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>The demon* graphic came out of a little blitz of making Y2K-inspired graphics that really sparked the idea to make this zine. The idea is that it’s like some hacker’s insignia or something. It’s built using Times New Roman Bold Italic, which definitely harkens back to the Windows 95 era. Also, I love the idea of creating an @ symbol with other letters.</p>
      
    <p>The "ghost" typography is the best Y2K-inspired piece I’ve made by far. It’s one of those that felt like too much of a rip off, but after sitting on it for several days and revisiting the work that inspired it, it actually is fairly unique and stands on its own. I really like it! Added a tamagotchi as the cherry on top. And finally, there's a promotional photo of my first car, a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. The "nerve" logotype has no connection to the image and was inspired by ASCII art.</p></td>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>Now we’ve got some PS1 stuff! I did a whole spread based on my disc-content PS1 fan site, but stripped most of it away to keep this zine a distinct project. What’s left is a recreation of the Vib Ribbon character and an isometric illustration of the psone combo that I’m really happy with. The page also features crop circles, the button from "The Truman Show," and a semi-failed type experiment of the word "eulogy."</p>
    <p>The big "NO" behind a chainlink fence is actually very cool looking. Kinda stumbled into this design and am really happy with how striking it looks. It should probably be adapted to some protest art or something more meaningful.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>The next spread is a fake rave flyer and a few isolated assets. The word “heaven” was created by applying the “bloat and pucker” distort tool in illustrator to Compacta, a great font used several times elsewhere in the zine. The “April 20” is an experimental font I think I got from generativefonts.xyz. the "ghoul" logo was an early and cheap attempt at Y2k-inspired graphics. The sticky hand is from <strike>a vending machine</strike> an icon set I created with Nick Hamze called Nostalgicons. The statue photo is from Unsplash.</p>
      
    <p>The CLUB XCEL name was thought up by my friend, Jesse. It's a great club name! The logo I made for it is very simple, but I think it's charming. It's meant to somewhat look like a pulsating subwoofer.</p></td>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>This is a fun spread! There's a lot going on here: old photos from the aforementioned disposable camera, recycled typography projects and icons, and some background dialogue from the 2001 J-horror movie “Pulse.” The font used for that  block of text is one I made years ago called Deimos. The angels are old public domain illustrations vectorized by Heritage Type. Oh, and there’s a nice isometric minidisk illustration I made awhile back. (I’ve never even used a minidisk, but they look really cool.)</p>
        
    <p>The cross photo was setup outside of a church next to our old apartment complex. It was really striking in person. A brutal instrument of torture covered in flowers — a world of contrasts! I also really like the house photo, peering over the fence. Ominous suburbia.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>This spread was one of the last I designed — maybe you can see me running out of steam! The big pattern is from Brion Gysin's DREAM MACHINE. A weird art/psychological experiment that William S. Burroughs was way into. Basically you print a large version of this bad boy, cut those shapes out, and form the page into a cylinder. You then place the cylinder on a turntable with a lightbulb suspened in its center. If you spin it at a certain frequency  and stare at it with your eyes closed, the strobing lights could <i>possibly</i>, eventually induce hallucinations without the use of drugs. (I don't buy it, but it's a cool and weird art project!)</p>
    <p>On the facing page, there are a few bits of logotype, a drawing of Parappa the Rapper, a PS1 (black) disc, and an outline of my regular/favorite running trail.</p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>Here's another public domain illustration given new life by Heritage Type. Along with a "not mobile friendly" graphic that was originally made for the scrapped disc-content zine page. (I have some personal beef with responsive design! Like David Lynch complaining about people watching movies on their phone. There are certain websites that should be viewed on desktop!)</p>
      
    <p>"The ? Remainz" is a great Gang Starr song that I listened to <i>so many</i> times while making this. The "BETTER THINGS ARE POSSIBLE" text is a core tenant of my political idealogy. The APE-X HUD was just for fun and doesn't mean anyhting. And finally, the RAVE graphic also doesn't mean anything. It was an attempt at Y2K-style typography that simultanesously ended up looking too much like its inspiration AND a lot worse than its inspiration, so I smashed the fucker.</p></td>

    <td class="tg-c3ow"><img src="images/ephemera-10.png" width="300px"></td>
    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>This spread was made early on in the design process. The "rubicon" graphic is one of the first Y2K-inspired pieces I created, so I guess I have some fondness for it. However, it's only good because it uses an existing font. I simply added the outlines and extra dots (and the 3D/chrome effect). The font is called Hybrid and can be found on Dafaont. It always feels better when your design is fully custom, but hey, sometimes this happens.</p>
    <p>On the other page, there's one more piece of public domain illustration from Heritage Type. It's a demon, I think? There's also a fake album cover, an old "liquidate billionaires" sticker I made, some razor blades, and a disposable camera photo of a semi truck. The "bad days" cross isn't meant to be super meaningful, but wow, juxtaposing anything negative with a cross certainly creates a mood, huh? </p>

    <td class="tg-wgsn"><p>This back cover was pretty fun to make — I've always liked label design and the layout of fine print. The actually-working QR code is paired with a fake barcode to throw you off. But you scanned it and found this treasure trove of supplemental information, so props to you! The numbers correspond with E-P-H-E-M-E-R-A and then also include 420 and 69. The shapes on the left are the heavily distorted letters of "EPHEMERA," again using the pucker and bloat tool.</p>
      
    <p>And hey, that covers everything, I think? Huge thanks for looking. It's super fun to spend a lot of time on a very silly project that only a handful of people will see. I highly recommend it!</p>
