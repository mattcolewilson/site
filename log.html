<h2>Changelog</h2>
<p>This is a list of notable updates to the site. Some dates may be approximate. Try not to worry about it.<br><br></p>
        
<h2>2022.11.27 Sunday</h2>
<p>Added a status.cafe widget to the homepage and blog page.</p>
    
<h2>2022.11.26 Saturday</h2>
<p>Launched a new version of my website, heavily inspired by <a href="https://dom.ink/" target="_blank">dom's website ↗</a>. (Ripped off with permission. Thanks much, Dom!)</p>

<h2>Living for Free on the Information Superhighway</h2>

<p>This site was coded using Brackets, an open source text editor, and is hosted for free on GitHub Pages. At the time of writing (and based on my limited knowledge), this is the cheapest way to have a website. The only thing I pay for is the domain, which is the standard $12/year (arguably an optional expense.)</p>
    
<p>I'm mentioning this because the leading site builder charges individual users nearly $200/year to have a website. Obviously, they offer templates and tools that make building a site much easier, but the high cost is a huge barrier to entry. In addition, you would also be relying on the whims of a multi-million dollar corporation and letting them harvest data from your site visitors. This is not a good transaction, especially for regular people who just want to have a website.</p>

<p>I mean no disrespect to my fellow internet residents. You do what's best for you! Maybe the trade off is worth it to some people. Or maybe not everyone cares about this stuff. But I can't help feeling strange when I go to a regular person's website and I'm required to click "accept" on an agreement to have my data harvested — just to read some text and look at some images. I don't think this sort of thing should be normalized, personally.</p>
    
<p>All this to say, there is a better way! To be clear, I'm not saying I have it all figured out. (Probably worth noting here that GitHub is not free from sin.) And I'm not saying it's exactly easy to stand up a website. But learning some basic HTML and CSS can get you a very long way, especially if you simply want to share your thoughts and art or otherwise express yourself.</p>
    
<p>This isn't exaclty a manifesto, but I'm strongly in favor of a return to the independent web. I would love to visit websites that were made by human beings instead of corporations and algorithms. If that's something you're interested in, I've listed a few resources that have helped me along the way.</p>
