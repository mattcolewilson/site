<h2>Magic Needles Magic Knife — Book Design</h2>
    
<p>My good friend, Brice, has self-published their first novel and I got to do the graphic design! It's a <i>"new-adult urban fantasy set in the secret side-streets of Cairo, full of magical peoples, curses, hijinks, and knitting."</i></p>
    
<p>It was a pleasure to design the cover and do the typesetting to help bring the novel to life. This project is in the running to be my favorite of the year, as it's extremely fulfilling to help a friend make a cool thing.</p>

<p>And as with every new project, I also learned a lot of things. I've never had to wrangle such a massive amount of text before — 390 pages worth! It was a very interesting challenge and has deepened my appreciation for book design.</p> 
    
<p>Go buy a copy! It's a great read and will look really nice on your shelf.</p>
