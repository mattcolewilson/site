<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>Hey, remember blogs? Those were neat. This is my little attempt at making one. These aren't super polished or well thought out essays or anything. Just getting out some thoughts — putting some pixels on the screen — you know, for fun. Posts are in order from newest to oldest. Updated extremey sporadically.</p>
    
<p>Also, this page specifically is best viewed on a computer. Good luck.</p>

<h2>2022.11.16 – The Death of a Bird</h2>
<p>Like a whole lot of other weirdos, I’ve been watching Twitter be destroyed by one of the worst dudes over the last couple of weeks. It’s been pretty entertaining, to be honest, but I think the goofs have run their course. And now it’s just kinda sad to see a thing that was *kinda* cool (the high-water mark of social media, for whatever that’s worth) be dismantled by a complete buffoon.</p> 

<p>It’s hard to say anything definitive about Twitter, as it contains multitudes. And maybe most of it has been very bad. But I generally had a pretty good time there. I got to know some neat people, was introduced to lots of new artists and ideas, and was able to participate as a virtual audience member and see a lot of funny and sad and scary shit unfold in realtime.</p> 

<p>And there are a handful of positive associations that are very specific to that website. Like, where would Famicase (my favorite online event of the year) happen if not on Twitter? What about the little graphic design communities I like to check in on? What about all the parasocial relationships I feel the need to maintain? Many of these things don’t currently exist outside of Twitter and would be difficult to rebuild.</p> 

<p>But there are also the numerous downsides. The site has taken so much of my time and energy that would have been better spent elsewhere. I learned about so many horrible people and their beliefs and regularly had my attention span completely obliterated. And what was gained, really?</p> 

<p>Just a few nights ago I spent a large portion of an evening scrolling through tweets that rarely gave me any sort of positive feeling — and I realized I could’ve spent the last couple of hours playing video games or watching a movie or reading a book instead. Like, I somehow chose to read a bunch of truly pointless tweets instead of participating in any of my actual hobbies? What the fuck is wrong with me?</p> 

<p>And yeah, that’s largely a me problem. I can’t blame the site for that (although it has been psychologically engineered to keep users on the platform as much as possible no matter the cost). So, I guess the point I’m getting at is that maybe even if it survives this very strange time — I should probably stop using it anyway. At least as often as I do.</p> 

<p>It’s a weird thing. When I started writing this journal entry, I thought it was going to have more of a mournful tone. Like, I have genuinely started to feel bad that Twitter is dying such a lame death. But as I think back on the good stuff, there are really only a handful of things that come to mind. (And I’m really thinking here.) There are probably only like 15 people I actively want to keep up with, a handful of fun moments, and Famicase. The rest, to me personally, is just over-engineered psychological manipulation and stuff that’s been either frustrating or depressing.</p> 

<p>Of course, I should probably mention that there’s loads of good stuff elsewhere that would be difficult to rebuild if Twitter does die. It’s been a huge tool for activism, collective action, communication, etc, etc. But I’m really only equipped to talk about my little sliver of (mostly pointless) experience.</p> 

<p>So I dunno, maybe the recent downward spiral provides the opportunity for a clean exit. (And if it does survive, I gotta figure out a way to break my bad habits.)</p> 

<p>But I guess the big question is: what’s next? Where do we all go once it’s over? Most of the internet has been destroyed by data harvesting and advertising. There aren't many good options, and I don’t think we’ll all settle in the same place. I mean, I currently love Cohost.org and would love to see my mutuals flock there. But I don’t think it’ll happen — and if it did, it won’t really be the same.</p> 

<p>And maybe this shake up will be good? Obviously I wish it happened under different circumstances. But I’ve been saying for a long time now that the internet would be much better if we all had our own little websites. Like, it’d be truly wonderful to just go visit a friend’s website to see what they’re doing. Instead of being constantly manipulated and marketed to by megacorporations. But I just doubt such a utopia is possible.</p> 

<p>But hey, we’ll see. I got no answers. Time will tell. RIP.</p>

<h2>2022.03.05 — Things on my Desk</h2>
<p>Starting at the back-left corner of my desk, there’s a small "Casio Vintage Collection" tin box. This box unsurprisingly came with a rerelease of a vintage Casio digital watch. (I have a matching one at work from another purchase. I really like Casio digital watches, but almost exclusively wear the all-black G-Shock.)</p>

<p>The Casio box is filled with a bunch of partially-used Field Notes notebooks and a few pencils. I like to always have a bunch of these notebooks around, but I’m pretty bad at journaling IRL (and journaling online, too, but I’m working on it.)</p>

<p>Hanging off the left corner of the front notebook is a risographed “I Love Horror Movies” button. I got this button from a fellow designer as part of a trade. This one is pink with dark grey text. I have another one that’s blue with pink text on my messenger bag.</p>

<p>In front of this is a real-life mockup of my first Famicase entry on a clear acrylic display stand. This is a prized possession, as I’m a huge fan of the Famicase exhibit and will be participating in the exhibit this year.</p>

<p>And finally, in front of all this stands a small figurine (originally a keychain) of Dori from A Day of Us. If you’re unfamiliar, A Day of Us is an extremely cute and charming slice-of-life cartoon on YouTube.</p>

<p>Next to this setup is a yellow Game Boy Color in a black 3D-printed display stand. The yellow variation (or “dandelion,” if you’re being technical) is my favorite from the lineup. It’s somehow even better than the translucent version. This particular shade of yellow may just be my favorite color (aside from black, of course).</p>

<p>Loaded inside the Game Boy is a Wario Land 3 cartridge. I’m a big fan of Wario — I even have a tattoo of bat-Wario from Wario Land 4. Behind this is a small stack of other games nestled inside of a black 3D-printed cartridge holder. I got all this 3D printed stuff from a generous coworker several years ago. They’re a little crusty if you look close, but they work well and make this setup look really nice!</p>

<p>All of this is on top of a bootleg Link’s Awakening box I got from an internet friend and frequent collaborator. It looks just like the real thing, and for a fraction of the cost, I’m sure. To the right of this setup is a date stamp I got for my birthday a few years ago. I really love this thing and use it anytime I attempt to journal or send a letter.</p>

<p>In front of the date stamp are two Polaroids. The back of the desk has a desk-length opening for wire management, and these two Polaroids stand in that gap. The photo on the left is one of my partner that I took on the side of a road many years ago. She’s standing in front of a distant, derelict house on a country road in the Ozark Mountains. We randomly pulled over there on a trip back from visiting my dad. It feels like it’s from another time — like, I really doubt we would pull over to take a photo these days. But it’s a great photo!</p>

<p>The photo on the right is of my late dog Pepe sitting on our old white couch. He was a Bichon Frise and was the nicest dog I’ve ever met. The white couch was a horrible mistake. It looked great at first, but was almost immediately ruined by having two dogs. Definitely don’t get white furniture, especially if you have housepets.</p>

<p>We’re half way through now — getting to the computer stuff. In the middle of the desk is a computer monitor, with a soundbar and keyboard in front of it. (The desktop is on the floor.) The computer is a CyberPower pc, which came with a gaming mouse and keyboard. I really like the set up, but it does sort of have a “gamer” aesthetic. Everything is red and black, with a few unnecessary LED lights. It’s not too bad, though. And it did show me how nice it can be to use a weighted mouse. I just don’t understand the desire to have differently colored WASD keys and color-changing lights.</p>

<p>Tucked away behind the right side of the monitor is a spray bottle of glasses cleaner. This is a must have. In front of this is usually where I keep my wallet and wristwatch if I’m not wearing them.</p>

<p>Next up is a trophy that reads “1998 Pow Wow — Winning Maiden: Fire Building.” This is from an annual event that used to be held in my childhood small town. This event was very likely cultural appropriation and doesn’t seem to be a thing anymore. A complicated artifact, I guess you could say. But my mom won this trophy in 1998 for being the fastest to build a fire using only a couple of sticks, which is pretty badass.</p>

<p>To the right is a Newton’s cradle. As a kid, I remember seeing these on office desks in movies and always thought I would need one if I ever got a desk job. I told my partner about this and she surprised me months later with one for my birthday. Kind of a gag gift, but also very sweet and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Next to that is a stick of chapstick. Burt’s Bees, hell yeah. We’re coming out of winter and my lips can get chapped as fuck. Hopefully I’ll be retiring this as soon as things start to warm up.</p>

<p>Now we’re all the way to the back-right corner, where a lamp sits, overlapping my desk and my partner’s. On top of the base of the lamp is a small, framed painting of Pepe that our friends commissioned for us after he passed away. An extremely thoughtful gift. I miss that very good dog!</p>

<p>The only thing that’s left is the bottom-right corner, where my computer mouse rests on a large mousepad. I also regularly have headphones and a macbook on my desk. Either the one from my day job when i’m working from home, or my personal Macbook.</p>

<p>The desk itself is white and about 4.25 feet wide. We got if from Ikea, so it’s pretty minimalist, with a few dents and scratches where I’ve dropped things over the years. My partner has a matching desk (without the scratches) and it’s immediately to the right of mine. To the left of my desk is the wall. Above our desks are 18 pieces of our favorite album art (nine on my side, nine on her side). And below are black rolling chairs sitting on top of black mats to protect the flooring.</p>

<p>I think that covers everything. It’s a fairly minimal and organized set up, but there are a few unique items sprinkled throughout to give it character and evoke some memories. It was fun to unpack everything!</p>
