<p>Went to Austria! Had a great time. Saw some sights, ate some food. Glad to be back, though. Also re-read The Stranger while on the trip. Good book. Really enjoying the holiday season. Hope you are, too!</p>

<p>Finished the Chucky series. Not perfect, but I had a great time. I legit thought "I can't believe they're doing this" almost every episode. Constant escalation, surprises, absurdity. Love the franchise so much. If anything else comes out and the regular crew is involved, I'm there.</p>

<p>Worked up a new <a href="https://snvn.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">SNVN</a> track. Like every new song that I've come up with, it's my favorite one yet. It's mostly made up of a very simple riff that I normally would have discarded. But I kept pushing it around and ended up really liking it.</p>

<p>Every now and then I see one of my fonts being used in the wild and it's always very exciting. I recently started an <a href="https://www.are.na/matt-cole-wilson/my-fonts-in-use" target="_blank">Are.na board</a> to keep track of them. If you ever see anything I've made being used, please let me know so I can add!</p>

<p>I've been playing the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heretic_hexen" target="_blank">Heretic + Hexen re-release</a> and it's great! They added map markers, which essentially fixes Hexen. The <a href="https://andrewhulshult.bandcamp.com/album/tome-of-power-official-heretic-hexen-game-soundtrack" target="_blank">updated soundtrack</a> is also fantastic. Highly recommended!</p>

<p>I feel a lil weird/guilty about not talking politics on this page. I don't really *want* to and I will not be getting in the habit of posting a take about everything. But there's a certain amount of grossness about avoiding the obviously inescapable conversation outright. So lemme just hit the two hottest topics real quick: Stop the genocide in Gaza. Trans rights.</p>

<p>Replayed Hitman: Blood Money recently (a classic). And also played through Hitman: Absolution for the first time. It's the black sheep of the franchise for good reason, but I kinda loved it.</p>

<p>Some living saint has shared their archive of the <a href="https://archive.org/download/BBC_Essential_Mix_Collection" target="_blank">BBC Radio 1 Essentials Mix</a> going as far back as 1993.

<p>Picked up the 33 1/3 book about The Moon and Antarctica by Modest Mouse. A top 5 favorite band, for sure, but I hadn't listened to them in a bit and it's fun to fall back into a comfortable rabbit hole. Cool book and book series, too! Definitely wanna read more of these.</p>
