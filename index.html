<article><img src="images/manniq.gif" alt="An animated GIF cycling through a few different images. The first is a Famicom cartridge with a label that reads MANNIQ. The two Ns in the center of the word mirror each other, creating a down arrow, which has a lime green circle behind it. Behind all of this is a wireframe 3D model of a man running. The second set of images are posters advertising this fictional game with the tagline Know Your Enemy. Next, are closeups of poster details, including a 3D wireframe rendition of the down arrow and a closeup of the wireframe man’s hand. And finally, a closeup of the MANNIQ logo is displayed before the GIF starts over.">
