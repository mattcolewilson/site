<columns>

<article><img src="images/manniq.gif" alt="An animated GIF cycling through a few different images. The first is a Famicom cartridge with a label that reads MANNIQ. The two Ns in the center of the word mirror each other, creating a down arrow, which has a lime green circle behind it. Behind all of this is a wireframe 3D model of a man running to the left. The second set of images are posters advertising this fictional game with the tagline Know Your Enemy. Next, are closeups of poster details, including a 3D wireframe rendition of the down arrow and a closeup of the wireframe man’s hand. And finally, a closeup of the MANNIQ logo is displayed before the GIF starts over.">

<article><img src="images/tumblr-mug.jpg" alt="A coffee mug sits in a white, featureless environment. The mug features a graphic of an old Tumblr mascot, which is a lowercase t with half-closed eyes. The mascot is looking at a laptop with text above that reads: Don’t talk to me until I’ve checked my Tumblr.">

<article><img src="images/tacobell.gif" alt="A low-resolution 3D model of a to-go bag and large drink from Taco Bell rotate in front of a black background. The models are made up of a relatively small number of polygons, reminiscent of early 3D graphics used in PlayStation 1 video games.">

<article><img src="images/kilby-pix.gif" alt="A pixel font appears on screen, one letter at a time, spelling out: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The letterforms are in white and the background is a deep blue, which is meant to be a nod to error screens on late 90s Windows computers.">

</article><article><img src="images/pixel-blobs.png" alt="Text is displayed over a blue photograph of a cloudy sky. The text in the top-right of the image is dark blue and lists the alphabet in lowercase characters. The text in the bottom-left is in white and reads: wonder what's next. The text itself is another pixel-like font with rounded corners. It’s similar to Boba Mono, which is displayed nearby, but this font is smaller and softer. It also has a few distinct quirks, such as the hole in the letter e being filled in, making the letters feel a little blurry or is if they have been impacted by ink bleed.">

<article><img src="images/ghostcab.gif" alt="The words Ghost Cab appear in black and white in front of a solid yellow background. The text is heavily stylized and is meant to evoke 1970s funk aesthetics through an early 2000s lens. Behind the text is a checkerboard line, a design element commonly used on taxi cabs, that infinitely scrolls from right to left.">

<article><img src="images/tumblr-bumper.gif" alt="An animated GIF cycles through a series of images depicting various bumper stickers. The various messages these stickers communicate include: God Bless my Tumblr Followers / Do you love the color of the sky? / I like your shoelaces / Honk if you use Tumblr. And lastly, my personal favorite: text that reads I Will Never Stop Posting in front of a field of flames.">

<article><img src="images/fragment.jpg" alt="A large, abstract 3D object floats in a blue-gray void. The object is made of jagged shapes seemingly jutting out at random. There’s a source of light creating a glow from either within the object or behind it. Surrounding the object are bits of text and abstract icons, suggesting a user interface. The largest text reads Fragment: Picking up the pieces. The rest is indecipherable.">

<article><img src="images/echo.png" alt="A logo for the software product Echo appears in front of a dark navy background. Starting from the left, there’s an icon depicting three circles bisected by a horizontal line. Even though this icon is symmetrical, it contains the shape of a lowercase e. Next to this icon is the word ECHO in a geometric sans-serif typeface.">

<article><img src="images/hypik.png" alt="The word Hypik, in white, on a solid gray background. The wordmark is made up of horizontal lines and dramatic 45 degree angles. The design is meant to evoke the vectorheart graphic design movement.">

<article><img src="images/y2kamera.gif" alt="A stylized logo that reads Y2Kamera. The logo is at a dramatic angle, which makes it look like it’s coming out of the screen. There’s also a circular shape swooping behind it, giving it the appearance of movement and added death. All of these attributions, in combination with the color choices (and the name), hopefully evoke graphic design work from the early 2000s.">

<article><img src="images/bend-outdoors.jpg" alt="An embroidered patch rests on a rocky surface. The patch depicts a simplified, symmetrical landscape of three trees in front of two mountains, beneath a rising sun. This image is made up of thick, dark lines and blocks of color. Below the landscape is text that reads Bend Outdoors.">
