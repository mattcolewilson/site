<h2>ghost cab (famicase)</h2>

<p><span style="color: black;">
I’m extremely excited to be participating in Famicase 2022! If you’re unfamiliar, Famicase is an annual exhibit in Tokyo that displays fan-made Famicom cartridges designed by people from all over the world. It’s an overlap of my two biggest interests: graphic design and retro video games. I’ve been following the exhibit for a long time and finally submitted a design this year:</span></p>
    
<p><span style="color: black;">
<b>GHOST CAB:</b> <i>Welcome to the Acheron City Cab Company! Your job is simple: drive each passenger to their final destination. It looks like you're our only driver today, so we may need you to do some overtime. Good luck and don't scratch the car!</i></span></p>

<p id="columns"><span style="color: black;">One of my initial ideas for this project was to do something inspired by R4: Ridge Racer Type 4. I love the black and yellow branding and general aestethics of that game. But at some point, I incorporated a checkered flag pattern into the design and was instantly reminded of taxi cabs. And it's impossible to think of taxis and video games without thinking of Crazy Taxi, which then became a big inspiration.<br><br>
    
I envision Ghost Cab to be a top-down driving game, like the Game Boy Color port of Driver. The twist is, this game is set in an urban underworld and your goal is to drive the recently deceased to the afterlife. Obviously inspired by a certain mythological boatman. Each customer pays a fare and your goal is to make as much money as possible before your shift ends.<br><br>
    
I've been really into Y2K aesthetics lately, so I really leaned into the Dreamcast + Crazy Taxi + Jet Set Radio vibes, with maybe a little Grand Theft Auto sprinkled in. Generally shooting for 70s funk viewed through a late-90s lens.<br><br>
    
It's been one of the most fun projects I've worked on and I'm stoked to have had a piece of my work hanging in a gallery in Tokyo!</span></p>
