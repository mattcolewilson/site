<article>
<p>Time continues to lurch forward, huh? Probably a good idea to pause and reflect on occasion. This is the start of (hopefully) an annual tradition. Maybe not always limited to design work, but who knows.</p>

<h1>I made an actual video game.</h1>
<p>It’s a very small game that takes less than five minutes to complete (if you’re good at platformers). But it’s playable, has a beginning and an end, and I’m extremely proud of it. Made in GB Studio, it’s can be played on real Game Boy hardware. But you can also play it in your browser. <a href="https://malyzar.itch.io/skate" target="_blank">Give it a shot!</a></p>

<h1>We launched a new forum.</h1>
<p>Well, to be honest, Will Hackworth did all the hard work. But me and Andrew Elmore gave feedback, designed some graphics, and told all our friends about it. It’s called Famiclub and it's meant to be a place to discuss video games and the various forms of creativity surrounding them.<a href="https://fami.club/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></p>

<h1>My book club turned a year old.</h1>
<p>In December 2023, the Last Words Book Club celebrated its one-year anniversary. It also gained a lot more members (but only a dedicated few are actually active). Together in 2023, we read 12 horror novels and hosted one movie watch party. Learn more and/or join at: <a href="last-words.club" target="_blank"</a>.</p>

<h1>I designed a book cover.</h1>
<p>My good friend Brice self-published their first novel and I had the immense honor of designing the cover. Legitimately one of the most satisfying graphic design projects I’ve ever worked on. This book is now on my bookshelf and even on the bookshelf at my local library. Bucket list stuff. (And there may be more on the horizon.) Get it on Amazon.</p>
