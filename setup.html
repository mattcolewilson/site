<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Here's are some notes on my current hardware and software setup. Pretty normal stuff here. This is mostly just me complaining about how expensive everything is. Written in November 2022.</p>
    
<hr>
        
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>2019 MacBook Pro</p>
    
<ul>
<li>13-inch</li>
<li>Two Thunderbolt 3 ports</li>
<li>120GB SSD</li>
</ul>
    
<p>I really love this Macbook, but I do think Apple products are overpriced and the overall vibe can get annoying. I don't think I'll buy another one when this one eventually dies. (Although I will be very sad to say goodbye.)</p>
    
<p>I received this Macbook as an award for a <a href="ulna.html">design project</a>, which I'm extremely thankful for. The only Apple product I've actually paid money for was an iPod Classic back in 2009, and I'm weirdly kind of proud of that.</p>
    
<p>Aside from headphones, I don't use any other accessories. Not even a mouse or external monitor. I like the trackpad and the small screen. Feels nice!</p>

<h2>Primary Software</h2>
    
<ul>
<li>Adobe Illustrator CC</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop CSS</li>
<li>Adobe InDesign CC</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with Adobe. I've had an almost universally-good time with their software. (Maybe I'm lucky, but I haven't ran into any of the common bugs some of my fellow designers complain about.) But the pricing model is bonkers. Paying monthly for a piece of software is a bad idea to begin with. But charging more than $50/month is borderline uforgivable.</p>
    
<p>Maybe this price is somewhat reasonable for power users who somehow work in every app (may god bless those lunatics). But I only regularly use Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. And because they're the industry standards that I've spent more than a decade learning, it really feels like I don't have much of a choice but to pay up.</p>
    
<p>I also really like Figma and had my eye on using it as a potential alternative to Illustrator. (Then maybe I could get away with just paying for InDesign.) But wouldn't you know it, Adobe bought them out earlier this year. Capitalism, baby!</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>Tertiary Tools</h2>
    
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Brackets</li>
<li>Field Notes notebooks</li>
</ul>
    
<p>I occasionally use Blender to make simple <a href="itemrender.html">3D models</a>. I've barely scratched the surface of this tool, but I'm constanlty impressed by the things that it can do. And it's open source? Hell yeah, that's what I'm talking about.</p>
    
<p>Brackets is another open source tool that I really like. It's a text editor that I use to write HTML and CSS and make little websites. The key feature, for me, is the live preview. I guess there are other open source text editors that do this too, but this is the one I use.</p>
    
<p>I also love having a notebook around. (Even if I rarely write in them, the <i>idea</i> of writing in them is endlessly appealing to me.) I try not to be loyal to too many brands,  but I've been a fan of Field Notes for many years and love almost everything they put out. Having a little stack of their notebooks within arm's reach is a must.
