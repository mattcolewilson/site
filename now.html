<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p> 

<h1>2024.03.06 – Wednesday</h1>

<img src="images/now.png">

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Submitted my Famicase entry and got in at #066. Feels good, man. Now I’m working on a similar, to-be-announced design challenge for Famiclub. No other irons in the fire at the moment. Still thinking about doing a website redesign, but not taking any immediate action. Takin’ it easy.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>Just got over a cold and am in that “deeply appreciating your normal health” phase. Getting back into jogging and maybe some other exercise stuff, too. I’m taking this Friday off to have a delayed birthday celebration for Alyson. Brother-in-law is visiting. Should be a nice time. Not much else new!</p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>Finished enough of the main game of Cyberpunk 2077 and am now a few missions into the DLC. Pretty surprised that the inciting incident has you protecting the President. Kinda lame, tbh. Still having a nice time, but am looking forward to dipping back into some retro stuff. Modern games are too big!</p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Just checked out <i>Mexican Gothic</i>, this month’s pick of the Last Words Book Club. Also reading <i>Herding Tigers</i>, a creativity/leadership book, for dayjob reasons.</p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>Bouncing around. Leaning heavy. Here are a few albums I’ve been spending time with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nine Inch Nails – The Fragile: Probably my second favorite NIN album.</li>
  <li>Kittie – Oracle: Wish I could go back in time and give this to my teenage self.</li>
  <li>Godflesh – Us and Them: Weirdo industrial metal pioneers. Into it.</li>
  <li>Zao – All Else Failed: Revisiting an old favorite. Long live Zao.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>Since my last update, I’ve watched <i>Killing of a Sacred Deer</i> (2017) and <i>Prisoners</i> (2013). I liked one, but not the other. I’ll let you guess which is which. Alyson and I have also been doing a slow rewatch of the Comedy Bang! Bang! TV show. It doesn’t hit as hard as it did 10 years ago, but there are some real good jokes in there.</p>

<h1>Thinking</h1>
<p>I’m a recent fan of the Tumblr account <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/forgottenflickr" target="_blank">Forgotten Flickr</a>, which curates and shares old, abandoned photos. Many of my favorites are from the mid 2000s. A lot of them are very mundane, taken by someone who probably just got a digital camera. Lots of photos of living spaces, sunsets, and cats. It’s a real trip to browse this blog and take a raw look into the recent past. Things looked so different just a few years ago. It’s wild and sad and sweet and beautiful. Highly recommended!</p>

<p>This has got me thinking of one of my personal regrets: that I have no photos of my childhood bedroom. I remember bits and pieces, but no longer have a mental image of the entire room and how it all fit together. It’s real easy to take your surroundings for granted and not realize how attached you are to the places you regularly inhabit. And when you move on and enough time passes, it’d be nice to have a photo or two that you could refer back to. Something to fan the embers of memory.</p>

<p>So anyway, I’m gonna try to take more photos of people and places and things and I think you should, too.</p>

<h1>Adminstrative Note</h1>
<p>I previously created an RSS feed for this page. But the work it takes to <i>also update that</i> anytime I update <i>this</i> created some friction. So, I've killed it for now. I also kinda like the ephemeral nature of this setup, anyway. Low stakes. Impermanence. But we'll see how it goes.</p>
