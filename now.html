<p>Bummed that Cohost is <a href="https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down" target="_blank">going away</a>. But newly energized and determined to have a nice time online. Life IRL is going well. We’ve been doing one of those big gradient puzzles. It's nice.</p>
<p>Playing: Elden Ring (Just got the DLC!)<br>
Listening: Busdriver - Perfect Hair<br>
Reading: Cold Hand in Mine - R. Aickman</p>

<p>We’ve been going to the gym lately, which has been great overall. (Who would have thought?) But the big thing they don’t tell you is how much time it takes. Work a full-time job and then <i>also</i> go to another place and exercise for like an hour? It melts the days away.</p>

<p>Finally figured out the basics of setting up an RSS feed. Sharing my notes, in case it can be of help to anyone else. This also goes over the basics of rosting (RSS direct posting). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NviGoDnR0LSOE6cJoBmITm_YIOM7EA5yMeydDpYkcXU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I will 100% post exclusive cat pics here. This is an old one that I had on hand to test things out. So, uh, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Maybe TMI but I got a vasectomy earlier this month and I highly recommend it. Not a big deal and it guarantees a bright, childless future. Posting this because if I had known how easy it was earlier, I probably would have done it years ago.</p>

<p>I'm into cassette tapes again. The last time I regularly used a cassette player was probably in middle school. Having a very nice time with this lil guy from Turntable Labs. Blessed to not be an audiophile.</p>

<p>When all the good places to post go away, you have to create your own. This is a total ripoff (with permission) of <a href="https://www.whack.zone" target="_blank">whack.zone</a>. I plan on posting little updates and occasional thoughts here. You can follow along via the <a href="feed.xml" target="_blank">Atom feed</a>, if you'd like.</p>
