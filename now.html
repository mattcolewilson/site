<small><a href="#0">2024.02.19 - Wednesday</a></small><p>It's already mid-February, huh. Moving right along. Not a lot to report. I have been working on some music and am excited about that. Some beep-boop type stuff. Also watching The Sopranos for the first time and it rocks. Hope you're doing alright! Thanks for stopping by.</p>

<img src="images/phytolith.gif" alt="A 3D album cover spinning in front of a yellow background. The album art is an abstract orange and yellow image. It's not clear what the image is exactly, but it looks a bit like glitchy, 3D lava.">
<p>Hello again. I just released some new music under the name SNVN. This EP is called PHYTOLITH. It's short and pretty fun, imo. Check it out <a href="https://snvn.bandcamp.com/album/phytolith" target="_blank">on Bandcamp</a>!</p>

<p>I am very late in doing this, but I wanted to publicly say: huge thanks to <a href="https://einarbaldvin.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Einar Baldvin</a> for letting me use his artwork for this <a href="https://ashenaltar.bandcamp.com/album/remnants" taget="_blank">music project</a>. And huge thanks to <a href="https://realmandritual.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Realm and Ritual</a> for making it physical. And last but not least, huge thanks to those of you who bought tapes or made digital purchases. All of this has been a complete surprise and an absolute thrill. <3</p>

<p>I've been kinda offline lately. Enjoying the holidays. A little late, but merry Christmas, and all that. Also, check out this great photo of Arcade I took a few days ago.</p>

<p>Dropping my first dungeon synth project! Tapes will be available this Friday from the <a href="https://realmandritual.bandcamp.com/album/remnants" target="_blank">Realm and Ritual Demo Series</a>. But in the meantime, you can <a href="https://ashenaltar.bandcamp.com/album/remnants" target="_blank">listen here</a>.</p>

<p>Obligatory post-election update. Not much nice to say. It sucks that this country is so dumb and angry. Gonna try to focus on the things I can control, I guess. Hope you're doing ok.</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://record.club/malyzar" target="_blank">Record Club</a> and it's pretty neat. (It's kind of like GoodReads, but for music.) I now have three invites, so if you wanna try it out, shoot me an email!</p>

<img src="images/2024.10-tapes.jpg" alt="Two small stacks of cassette tapes sitting on a white desk. The 12 tapes are: Bad Brains (self-titled), BjÃ¶rk (Post and Vespertine), Gel (Only Constant), Chat Pile (Cool World), Jeff Rosenstock (Post), Godflesh (Post Self), Iron Butterfly (In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida), Bob Dylan (Highway 61 Revisited and The Basementa Tapes), and Mountain (On Top).">
<p>Check out my little cassette tape collection! Recent acquisitions â€“ from Love Garden Sounds in Lawrence â€“ include Vespertine by BjÃ¶rk, the Bad Brains self-titled debut, and Jeff Rosenstock's Post. (I kinda regret getting Post instead of Hellmode. So it goes.)</p>

<p>Kinda want to make a plain text website and/or start using bearblog to write more. But I will probably end up just playing Elden Ring instead of doing either of these things.</p>

<p>Andrew Elmore dropped a <a href="https://satellitesound.bandcamp.com/album/wavebeam" target="_blank">new album</a> earlier this month. Almost snuck by me, just finding out now. It's great. PSP beats! Do it!</p>

<p>I'm (what feels like) half way through the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and it fuckin' rocks. Also listening to <a href="https://www.bonfireside.chat/" target="_blank">Bonfireside Chat</a> as I go and it's such a wonderful way to experience a game. Highly recommended.</p>

<img src="images/2024.10-rex.jpg" alt="A black cat lying on a desk.">
<p>Had a nice three-day weekend and am feeling refreshed. Went to a pumpkin patch with some friends and then took a day trip to Lawrence, KS. Poked around downtown, visited the art museum, etc. Had a good time, but nothing feels better than coming home.</p>

<p>Got the <a href="https://youtu.be/YnDWVWZrZrE?si=t_-KwpI4korc5L4D" target="_new">new Chat Pile</a> cassette and am listening to it for the first time while posting this update. So far, it's great. Haven't gotten into many new bands in a while, but I'm really liking these guys.</p>

The patch rests on a window sill, a backyard can be seen through the window in the distance."><p>RIP Cohost.org. I had a nice time. I'm also trying to avoid over inflating that website's importance. But it shutting down feels like the end of something. A last gasp. Social media is essentially over, as far as I'm concerned.Â Personal sites, forums, and RSS feeds are the future. And that's not a bad way to go, I guess.</p>

<small><a href="#14">2024.09.30 - Monday</a></small><p>Puzzle update: we (finally) finished and all the pieces were present! I take back the disparaging comments I made earlier about our cats. They're good boys, afterall.</p>

<small><a href="#13">2024.09.27 - Friday</a></small><p>Listened to sad music all morning and have bummed myself out. (This is a rake I will continue to step on.) Anyway, I've said this before, but <a href="https://youtu.be/oHgCXhY6kZ0?si=VY9WeyeylX3uVFXc" target="_blank">If I Didn't Have Your Love</a> by Leonard Cohen is one of the best love songs ever written.</p>

<small><a href="#12">2024.09.26 - Thursday</a></small><p>Pushed a small update to the Links page. There's now (the start of) an 88x31 button wall. <a href="https://mattcolewilson.com/links.html#buttons" target="_blank">Check it out</a> and visit some cool websites.</p>

It's nice to have something to look back on if things change.)</p>

<small><a href="#10">2024.09.22 - Sunday</a></small><p>I am now prepared for the Cohost shutdown. Got a solid setup going here. Finished making a list of the people I want to keep an eye on. And Iâ€™m becoming a total RSS sicko. See you on the other side.</p>

<p>Took this photo a couple nights ago. Feels like something I would've taken with my shitty phone in like 2008 (non-derogatory).</p>

<p>Puzzle progress report: The cats finally fucked with the puzzle. Found some pieces down the hall and one in the linen closet. It was bound to happen, I guess. This whole thing will probably end in frustration. So it goes.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been going to the gym lately, which has been great overall. (Who would have thought?) But the big thing they donâ€™t tell you is how much time it takes. Work a full-time job and then <i>also</i> go to another place and exercise for like an hour? A total day melter.</p>

<p>Finally figured out the basics of setting up an RSS feed. Sharing my notes, in case it can be of help to anyone else. This also goes over the basics of rosting (RSS direct posting). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NviGoDnR0LSOE6cJoBmITm_YIOM7EA5yMeydDpYkcXU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I will 100% post exclusive cat pics here. This is an old one that I had on hand to test things out. So, uh, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Maybe TMI but I got a vasectomy earlier this month and I highly recommend it. Not a big deal and it guarantees a bright, childless future. Posting this because if I had known how easy it was earlier, I probably would have done it years ago.</p>

<p>I'm into cassette tapes again. The last time I regularly used a cassette player was probably in middle school. Having a very nice time with this lil guy from Turntable Labs. Blessed to not be an audiophile.</p>
