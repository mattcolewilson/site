<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p> 

<h1>2024.05.31 – Friday</h1>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Not doing much outside of the day job lately! I’ve been heavily procrastinating on personal projects. Planning to eventually make a bunch of artwork for fictional compact discs. And I still want to make a Blair Witch Project zine. But nothing tangible to speak of at the moment.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>Recently celebrated 13 years of marriage. It’s the best! And I got a new tattoo of some Tom Waits lyrics: “We’re chained to the world and we all gotta pull.” A good line, imo.</p>

<p>I’ve also been stumbling down a rabbit hole of music making stuff. It started by getting into Godflesh and learning about the sounds they’re able to get out of a drum machine. I found a way to program beats using samples from that same drum machine, which has been a lot of fun. And then I stumbled into the free Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer emulator Dexed, which is bonkers. I do not really know what I’m doing, but I’m enjoying my time.</p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>Thanks to the incredible <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" target="_blank">N64 recompilation project</a>, I’ve been playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. I had Ocarina of Time back in the day, but had never played Majora’s Mask until now. It’s great! The time constraints aren’t as stressful as I thought they’d be and it’s mostly a joy to play. Especially with all the nice features of the recompilation. Highly recommended! </p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Finished reading The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones for the <a href="https://last-words.club" target="_blank">book club</a>. Loved it. A few flaws stick out more on this second read, but I’m still a big fan of SGJ. Also finished Herding Tigers for work. Solid. Up next is Tender is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica.</p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, I’ve been listening to a lot of Godflesh. My current favorite is <i>Love and Hate in Dub</i>. Also recently discovered Botch. (Saw someone on the internet call Norma Jean a Botch ripoff, lol, so I had to check them out.) A great band! We Are the Romans!</p>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>Watched The Super Mario Bros. Movie and pretty strongly disliked it! I think it’s a bad movie! Also revisited Mars Attacks for the first time since childhood. Pretty fun, but I’m not really a Tim Burton guy. And finally, we watched Madame Web and the reports are true: it’s not great. </p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Big clouds, ice cream sandwiches, and <a href="https://jackapedia.neocities.org/weblog/weblog_index#ufos-show" target="_blank">this post by Jack Grimes</a> about UFOlogy.</p>
