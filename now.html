<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p> 

<h1>2024.07.17 – Wenesday</h1>

<img src="images/now.png">

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>I haven’t been doing very much design outside of the day job. A few tiny freelance projects and some doodles, but nothing to report.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>We’ve been going to the gym regularly for several weeks now and it’s been great! Who would have thought? Have also been enjoying the summer, in general. Went to the lake. Will return to the lake. Etc. My big, personal creative project right now is working on a dungeon synth EP. More to come, but I’m pretty stoked about it.</p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>Took a break from Majora’s Mask to play through the Stanley Parable and really enjoyed all the new Ultra Deluxe content. A must-play for fans of video games, I’d say. I need to return to Majora’s Mask but haven’t been playing video games lately. (Also really itching to do another Elden Ring playthrough in anticipation for the DLC.) </p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Finished up <i>Tender is the Flesh</i> by Agustina Bazterrica for the book club. A hell of a book. One of my favorites in recent years. Currently reading <i>Devil House</i> by John Darnielle of Mountain Goats fame. About half way through and it’s pretty good. My second book of his, and I’m liking it quite a bit more than the first (which was <i>Universal Harvester</i>). </p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>We caught a Modest Mouse show a couple of weeks ago. It was great. Isaac’s looking healthy. Happy for him. I’ve also been submerging myself in the fascinating genre of dungeon synth. Some recent favorites include: Ghoëst, Forgotten Relic, Gray Friar, Moss Knight, Bardic Whispers, and most of the stuff being put out by Realm and Ritual. </p>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>Have not been watching anything, aside from the occasional YouTube video. I recently enjoyed the ThorHighHeels <a href="https://youtu.be/HOYor4gOvPg?si=0LdSGmRszxHgXtqC" target="_blank">video essay on Manhunt</a>. And Conner O’Malley’s new short: <a href="https://youtu.be/_2nzkiOaeqE?si=cBJazCTcjMnArCYZ" target="_blank">Coreys</a>. If you wanna count those.</p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Bonfireside Chat, Little Debbies Honey Bun ice cream, wired headphones, and <a href="https://jackapedia.neocities.org/weblog/weblog_index#nostalgia-show" target="_blank">this article</a> by Jack Grimes about nostalgia.</p>
