<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p>

<h1>2024.09.01 – Sunday</h1>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Nothing to show. Status quo. I have been tinkering with my personal dungeon synth project and designed some stuff for that. But I won’t be sharing anything until November. I haven’t been doing much cool design stuff outside of the day job for quite a while now. A few ideas here and there, but the energy tank has been a little low. So it goes, I suppose.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>It’s my birthday week and that’s nice. We did have to cancel a little day trip that we had been planning for months because I had a migraine that lasted 12 hours. Sucks, dude. But I’m over that now and am having a very nice and long holiday weekend.</p>

<p>As a birthday gift, I got a portable cassette player and am getting (back) into tapes. My modest collection now includes:</p>

<p>A handful of tapes that my dad sent me, including Iron Butterfly’s <i>In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida</i>. I was obsessed with this very same cassette as a kid and it’s been fun to revisit. Probably the best psychedelic rock song ever written. He also sent two Bob Dylan tapes, including <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>. (Shouting: “God said to Abraham, kill me a son!”) And <i>The Basement Tapes</i>, which I’m less familiar with and am looking forward to getting to know.</p>

<p>I got a handful of other tapes as birthday gifts, including <i>Post</i> by Björk on a really handsome pink cassette. <i>Post Self</i> by Godflesh, to satisfy the frequent industrial metal cravings. <i>Honed Blade</i> by Gel, the most exciting hardcore band of the last decade. And <i>Utilitarian</i> by Napalm Death. (Great album, bad cover art. Fairly standard for Napalm Death.)</p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>I have fallen back into Elden Ring. This is my fourth playthrough. It’s been long enough now that I’ve forgotten a lot of things, so I’m going through it more slowly and thoroughly than the last couple of times. Doing a dual katana build, but I think I’m going to respec soon and focus solely on the Nagakiba. I’m also relistening to Bonfireside Chat. Lots of Elden Ring on the brain lately. Maybe even too much. But listening to an in-depth podcast about a game, in between playing that game, is such a great way to interact with the medium.</p>

<p>Just got to Lyndell. Hanging out with Boc the Beautiful and protecting him from all harm. Encouraging Iron Fist Alexander to continue his journey of self improvement. Planning on eventually putting the crown on Ranni the Witch, once again. I did mess up the Goldmask quest, again. I’ve never been able to see that one through. Can’t win ‘em all. 
</p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Since the last post I finished <i>Devil House</i> by John Darnielle. I ultimately didn’t like it very much. But I will say there’s a big chunk in the last half that contains some of the saddest writing I’ve ever read. It basically gets a recommendation from me on the strength of that section alone. I also finished reading <i>In the House in the Dark of the Woods</i> by Laird Hunt. It’s a personal favorite and this was my third time reading it. I love it! It’s creepy and weird but also whimsical and surreal in a way that makes it feel extremely unique and special. Highly recommended. I also convinced my partner and a coworker to read it. Spreading the good word.</p>

<p>Also just put <i>Perfume: Story of Murderer</i> on hold at the library. Watched the movie long ago, but didn’t realize it was based on a novel. Which I discovered by finally looking up what the hell Nirvana’s "Scentless Apprentice" was about. Great work, Kurt. And the next book for the book club is <i>Cold Hand in Mine</i> by Robert Aickman. 
</p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>In addition to all the cassette stuff mentioned above, I’m still getting into dungeon synth. The <i>Vales of Light // Realms of Shadow</i> split by Moss Knight (and others) remains a favorite. Also really blown away by <i>Bloody Tears of the Desert</i> by Warlock Corpse. Some unbelievably cool stuff. Dark and moody, as you’d expect. But some of those grooves are straight up danceable. And the occasional black metal vocals somehow also fit into the mix.</p>

<p>Unrelated to DS, but I’m also excited for the new Chat Pile album and have the cassette pre-ordered. The two singles are killer. Still kinda stunned by <i>God’s Country</i>. Difficult subject matter all over that thing, but a great piece of American art.</p>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>We rewatched <i>The World’s End</i>. I went in expecting to like it less, but it’s still great. The best of the Cornetto Trilogy, imo. No other movies or shows, aside from YouTube stuff. Just not into movies right now, for some reason! But I am already thinking about doing some sort of <i>Halloween</i> rewatch in October. (Maybe not all of them this time, lol.) And will eventually revisit <i>Perfume</i>, once I finish the book.</p>
