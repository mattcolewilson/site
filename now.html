<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p> 

<h1>2024.03.20 – Wednesday</h1>

<img src="images/now.png">

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Currently working on a cover design for <a href="http://thebriceiswrite.com" target="_blank">Brice’s</a> next book. Not much else to report at the moment. Tinkering on this and that. Also really looking forward to the Famicase 2024 exhibit. Keep your eye out for #066. </p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>I’ve been a little bummed by recent events outside of my control. Ya know how it is. But personally, all is well. Glad it’s Spring. Glad I’m healthy and employed and what not. Hashtag blessed. Etc, etc. Oh, one thing I haven’t mentioned here: we’re doing a dry 2024. No booze for the whole entire year. So far, so good. </p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>I haven’t been playing much lately, but tonight I am diving back into the DLC of Cyberpunk 2077. One of my favorite things about this game is the photo mode. More games should have photo mode. Once I’m finished with this one, I think I’m gonna finally play Signalis.</p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Just finished reading <i>Mexican Gothic</i> by Silvia Moreno-Garcia for the <a href="https://last-words.club" target="_blank"Last Words Book Club</a>. I think it’s a little in the “not for me” column, but I get what it’s doing and it does it all very well. Just maybe a little to clean for my tastes? (I dunno, join the book club if you wanna talk about it!) Up next is <i>The Dreamer in Fire</i> by Sam Gafford. And I’m also still reading <i>Herding Tigers</i> for dayjob reasons.
</p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>Lately I’ve been obsessively listening to Squeeze by SASAMI. I was a big fan of “Sorry Entertainer” (the incredible Daniel Johnston cover) when it came out two years ago. But for whatever reason it’s taken me this long to give the entire album a listen. But now I’m hooked. My favorite track is “Say It.”</p>

<p>Another recent deep dive is You Want it Darker by Leonard Cohen. A hell of an album. “If I Didn’t Have Your Love” may be the best love song ever written </p>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>I recently rewatched Buzzard (2014) and Event Horizon (1997). Both classics.</p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Lay’s dill pickle flavored chips, the Sloppy Boys podcast, going on walks.</p>
