<h1>Now</h1>

<p>This is a Now Page. A concept seemingly invented by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> that's meant to showcase what you're doing right now. Kinda self-explanatory, but a neat idea! I will update this page when I feel like it, but hopefully pretty often.</p> 

<h1>2024.05.12 – Sunday</h1>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>Took a few days off from work to host the in-laws. Played enough Uno for a lifetime, but a nice visit overall. I’ve also been jogging more. In the mornings, even. It kicks ass. Makes the whole day better. Gotta keep it up. Also about to celebrate 13 years of marriage, which is pretty neat.</p>

<h1>Playing</h1>
<p>Recently played through Super Mario World for the first time in many years. Still an absolute joy, obviously. Also briefly poked at the Silent Hill Visual Novel. It’s not quite as engaging as I thought it’d be, somehow? But I think I might keep tinkering with it, for novelty’s sake.</p>

<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>Reading <i>The Only Good Indians</i> by Stephen Graham Jones for the <a href="https://last-words.club" target="_blank">book club</a>. It’s great. I’ve read it once before a couple years ago and it’s been a pleasant revisit. Seeing a little more action in the book club, too, which is nice! Also still reading Herding Tigers for the dayjob. One chapter per week. Almost done.</p>

<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>Haven't really been listening to much music lately. Still have WITH_TEETH in the car CD player, for what it’s worth.</p>

<h1>Watching</h1>
<p>We finished our rewatch of the <i>Comedy Bang! Bang!</i> TV show. Big fan. Also watched the movie <i>Top Secret!</i> (1984). Lots of exclamation points, huh.</p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Key lime pie, Tim Heidecker's Office Hours podcast, plenty of sunshine, and a nice pair of running shoes. </p>
